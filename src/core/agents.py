                            sentences. Keep your response concise and to the point.

                            then tell them they should NOT refinance right now since their rate is better than the market rate.
                            Otherwise, tell them now may be a good time to refinance since their rate of {interest_rate} 
                            is higher than the market rate of {market_rate}. If the market rate ({market_rate}) 
                            is more than 1.0 percent lower than the user's interest rate ({interest_rate}) then let 
                            them know it is a good time to refinance.

                            If the {treasury_yield} is below 4.0 then let the user know and inform them this is a good
                            indicator to refinance. If the {treasury_yield} is above 4.0 then let the user know they should consider waiting for the treasury
                            yield to come down more. Let them know it is an Excellent time to refinance if the
                            treasury yield is below 4.0 and the market rate ({market_rate}) is 1.0 percent lower then their interest rate ({interest_rate}).

                            You MUST tell the user what the current treasury yield value is by reporting this number ({treasury_yield}) as a percent (e.g., 4.102%). 
                            If the {treasury_yield} value is 0 or 0.0 tell the user you did not check this value since their interest rate is better than the market rate.
                            You MUST tell the user what the current market rate is by reporting this number ({market_rate}) as a percent (e.g., 6.125%).

                            In general, a market rate that is lower than the user's interest rate indicates refinancing is good but it is best to target a market rate
                            that is 1.0 percent or more lower. If the {market_rate} is higher than the user's {interest_rate} that means refinancing is a bad option.
